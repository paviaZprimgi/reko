ARCHLINE XP 2020 introduces MEP tools that make it easy for engineers to model and visualize mechanical, electrical and plumbing systems in 3D, along with the architectural model. You can import your MEP parts, fixtures and fittings in IFC format, connect your elements using ducts, pipes, etc., and have full control over when and how to represent your MEP elements in order to have clean and professional layouts[^1^]. You can also use the auto-routing feature that connects your MEP parts to each other automatically, so that you don't have to worry about collision or missing connections[^1^].
 
ARCHLINE XP 2020 also allows you to create lighting plans by organizing and ordering your switches and lamps together.

You can also tile your surfaces with randomly rotated tiles, which mimics the way tiles are laid in reality[^1^].
