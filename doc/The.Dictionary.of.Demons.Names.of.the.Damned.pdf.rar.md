One of the main sources of Belanger's book is *Daemonologie*, a treatise on witchcraft and demonology written by King James I of England and Scotland in 1597. In this book, King James argues against the skeptics of witchcraft and provides a detailed classification of demons and their powers. He also warns about the dangers of necromancy and sorcery, and advises his subjects on how to detect and prosecute witches. Belanger includes excerpts from *Daemonologie* in her book, as well as other similar works from the same period.
 
Another important source of Belanger's book is *The Lesser Key of Solomon*, a grimoire that contains a collection of rituals for summoning and controlling 72 demons. The grimoire is divided into five parts, each focusing on a different aspect of magic. The most famous part is the Ars Goetia, which lists the names, ranks, seals, and descriptions of the 72 demons. Belanger provides a comprehensive analysis of the Ars Goetia, as well as comparisons with other grimoires and traditions.
