For example, once Haroun al-Rashid asked Behlol Dana to sit on his throne and pretend to be the caliph. He then asked him what he would do if he had the power to rule. Behlol Dana replied that he would first punish Haroun al-Rashid for his crimes against the Ahlulbayt (AS) and their followers, and then he would free Imam Musa al-Kadhim (AS) from prison and honor him as the true leader of the Muslims. Haroun al-Rashid was enraged by this answer and ordered his guards to arrest Behlol Dana. But Behlol Dana quickly jumped off the throne and said that he was only joking and that he was not fit to be a caliph. He then ran away from the court, leaving Haroun al-Rashid speechless.
 
Another time, Haroun al-Rashid asked Behlol Dana to advise him on how to improve his rule and please Allah. Behlol Dana said that he should do three things: repent for his sins, release Imam Musa al-Kadhim (AS) from prison, and give back the rights of the Ahlulbayt (AS) and their followers. Haroun al-Rashid said that he could not do any of these things because they would undermine his authority and prestige. Behlol Dana then said that he should do three other things: increase his charity, perform more prayers, and fast more often. Haroun al-Rashid said that he could not do these things either because they would weaken his body and distract him from his affairs. Behlol Dana then said that he should do three more things: eat less, sleep less, and talk less. Haroun al-Rashid said that he could not do these things as well because they would make him hungry, tired, and bored. Behlol Dana then said that he had no more advice for him and that he should prepare for the Day of Judgment.
