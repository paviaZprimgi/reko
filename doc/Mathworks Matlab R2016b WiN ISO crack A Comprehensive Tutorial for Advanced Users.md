## Step 6: Explore the Features of Mathworks Matlab R2016b
 
Now that you have installed and cracked Mathworks Matlab R2016b on Windows, you can explore the features and capabilities of this software. Matlab R2016b offers many new and improved features for numerical computing, data analysis, and algorithm development. Some of the highlights are:

- Tall arrays for manipulating data too big to fit in memory. You can use tall arrays with hundreds of math, statistics, and machine learning algorithms without having to learn big data programming. You can also run your code on Hadoop clusters or Spark applications[^1^].
- Timetable data container for indexing and synchronizing time-stamped tabular data. You can use timetables to store and manipulate data that has timestamps, such as sensor data, financial data, or audio signals[^1^].
- String arrays to help manipulate, compare, and store text data efficiently. You can use string arrays to store text data of different lengths without padding or truncating. You can also perform common operations on strings, such as concatenation, splitting, searching, and replacing[^1^].
- Live Editor for creating scripts that combine code, output, and formatted text in an executable notebook. You can use the Live Editor to interactively write and run code, add equations and images, and create interactive controls[^2^].
- MATLAB apps for exploring different algorithms and methods with your data. You can use apps such as Classification Learner, Curve Fitting, Signal Analyzer, and Image Labeler to perform common tasks without writing code. You can also generate MATLAB code from the apps to automate or reproduce your work[^2^].
- MATLAB Compiler for deploying MATLAB applications on a Spark cluster. You can use MATLAB Compiler to create standalone applications or web apps that run on a Spark cluster. You can also use MATLAB Distributed Computing Server to scale your computations using tall arrays[^1^].
- Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox for processing out-of-memory data and tuning machine learning algorithm parameters. You can use big data algorithms for dimension reduction, descriptive statistics, clustering, regression, and classification with tall arrays. You can also use Bayesian optimization and neighborhood component analysis (NCA) for choosing optimal parameters and features for your machine learning models[^1^].

These are just some of the features of Mathworks Matlab R2016b that you can explore. For more information, you can check the release notes[^3^] or the documentation of Matlab R2016b.
