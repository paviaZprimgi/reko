Stylist Andrea Lieberman introduced her to the world of haute couture clothing, which inspired Stefani to launch her own fashion line named L.A.M.B. in 2004.[15] The line takes influence from a variety of fashions from different cultures and regions, including Guatemalan, Japanese, and Jamaican styles.[131] The line achieved popularity among celebrities and fashion lovers and is worn by stars such as Teri Hatcher, Nicole Kidman, and Stefani herself.[13][132] In June 2005, she expanded her collection with the less expensive Harajuku Lovers line, which she referred to as "a glorified merchandise line", with varied products ranging from a camera, mobile phone charms, and undergarments to fragrances and accessories.[133][134] In late 2006, Stefani released a limited edition line of dolls called "Love. Angel. Music. Baby. Fashion dolls". The dolls are inspired by the clothes Stefani and the Harajuku Girls wore while touring for the album and each doll has its own name and personality.[135]
  
In 2007, Stefani launched a perfume line as a part of her Harajuku Lovers product line. There are five different fragrances based on the four Harajuku Girls and Stefani herself called Love, Lil' Angel, Music, Baby and G (Gwen).[136] As of January 2011, Stefani has become the spokesperson for L'OrÃƒÂ©al Paris.[137]
