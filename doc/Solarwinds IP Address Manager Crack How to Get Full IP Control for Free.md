IP address management (IPAM) is a crucial task for any network administrator, as it involves planning, tracking, and managing how IP addresses are assigned to network devices. However, IPAM can also be complex, time-consuming, and prone to errors if done manually or with inadequate tools. That's why you need a reliable and powerful IPAM solution that can help you save time, avoid conflicts, and optimize your IP space.

One of the best IPAM solutions on the market is SolarWinds IP Address Manager (IPAM), a software that can provide you with centralized IP address management working hand-in-hand with unified DHCP and DNS administration[^1^]. SolarWinds IPAM can help you automate IP address tracking, integrate DHCP and DNS management across multiple vendors and platforms, alert you on IP address issues, troubleshoot and resolve IP conflicts, and report on your IP address usage and capacity[^2^].
 
With SolarWinds IPAM, you can benefit from the following features:
 
- **Automatic IP scanning:** SolarWinds IPAM can scan your network periodically and discover new devices and subnets. It can also update your IP inventory automatically and keep track of which IP addresses are in use, available, reserved, or transient.
- **IP address tracking:** SolarWinds IPAM can help you organize your IP space by creating custom groups, hierarchies, tags, and filters. You can also search for any IP address or device using various criteria, such as hostname, MAC address, vendor, or location.
- **Subnet discovery wizard:** SolarWinds IPAM can help you find and add subnets to your IPAM database using SNMP or ICMP scans. You can also import subnets from spreadsheets or other sources.
- **Hybrid DNS management:** SolarWinds IPAM can help you manage DNS records and zones across multiple DNS servers and platforms, such as Microsoft, Cisco, BIND, and AWS Route 53. You can also create DNS templates and apply them to multiple DNS servers at once.
- **Infoblox integration:** SolarWinds IPAM can help you integrate with Infoblox appliances and manage them from a single console. You can also migrate DHCP and DNS data from Infoblox to other platforms using SolarWinds IPAM.
