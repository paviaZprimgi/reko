# How to Make Your 3D Characters Walk in High Heels with SKAmotion
 
If you are a 3D artist or animator who uses DAZ Studio or Maya, you might have wondered how to make your female characters walk in high heels with realistic and elegant motion. You might have tried to adjust the poses and keyframes manually, but found it too tedious and time-consuming. Or you might have used some generic walk cycles, but found them too stiff and unnatural.

Fortunately, there is a solution that can save you a lot of hassle and make your 3D characters walk in high heels with ease and style. It is called SKAmotion, a collection of high-quality animation products for DAZ Studio and Maya. SKAmotion offers various walk cycles for different types of shoes, such as pumps, boots, sandals, and more. You can also choose between different levels of bounce and body morphs, depending on the size and shape of your character's breasts and glutes.
 
One of the most popular products from SKAmotion is the Gen 3 / V7 High Heel Walk, which is designed for Victoria 7 and Genesis 3 Female, two of the most successful models from Daz3d. This product contains six aniBlocks that walk on the spot and six that walk forward, so you can use them in any scene and camera angle. You can also mix and match them with other aniBlocks from SKAmotion or other sources to create more variations.
 
To use the Gen 3 / V7 High Heel Walk, you need to have DAZ Studio 4.5 or higher and Genesis 3 Female installed. You can also use Victoria 7 or any other Genesis 3 Female character that you like. You can apply any outfit or hairstyle that you want, as long as they are compatible with Genesis 3 Female. Then, you just need to drag and drop the aniBlock that matches your character's shoes and preferences to the timeline, and adjust the speed and duration as needed.
