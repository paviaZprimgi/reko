## Alphabet
 
Russian alphabet is based on the Cyrillic script, which has 33 letters: 10 vowels, 21 consonants, and 2 signs that do not have a sound of their own. The letters are written in both uppercase and lowercase forms. Here is the Russian alphabet with the corresponding English sounds:

| Ð Ð° | a as in father | Ð Ðº | k as in king |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

| Ð Ð± | b as in boy | Ð Ð» | l as in lamp |

| Ð Ð² | v as in van | Ð Ð¼ | m as in man |

| Ð Ð³ | g as in go | Ð Ð½ | n as in no |

| Ð Ð´ | d as in dog | Ð Ð¾ | o as in more |

| Ð Ðµ | e as in bed or ye as in yes | Ð Ð¿ | p as in pen |

| Ð Ñ | yo as in yo-yo | Ð  Ñ | r as in run (rolled) |

| Ð Ð¶ | zh as in measure | Ð¡ Ñ | s as in sun |

| Ð Ð· | z as in zoo | Ð¢ Ñ |<t

Phonetics
Phonetics is the study of the sounds of a language. Russian phonetics has some features that may be unfamiliar to English speakers. For example, Russian has a stress system, which means that one syllable in a word is pronounced louder and longer than the others. The stress can change the meaning of a word or a sentence. For example, Ð·Ð°Ð¼Ð¾Ðº (zamok) can mean either "castle" or "lock" depending on where the stress is. There is no fixed rule for the stress placement in Russian, so you have to memorize it for each word.

Another feature of Russian phonetics is the vowel reduction. This means that the vowels change their quality depending on whether they are stressed or unstressed. For example, the letter Ð¾ can sound like [o] as in more when stressed, or like [a] as in father when unstressed. The letter Ðµ can sound like [e] as in bed when stressed, or like [i] as in bit when unstressed. The vowel reduction affects the pronunciation of words and also the spelling of some endings.

A third feature of Russian phonetics is the consonant palatalization. This means that some consonants change their articulation when followed by a soft vowel (Ðµ, Ñ, Ð¸, Ñ, Ñ) or a soft sign (Ñ). For example, the letter Ð½ can sound like [n] as in no when followed by a hard vowel (Ð°, Ð¾, Ñ, Ñ), or like [n'] as in canyon when followed by a soft vowel or a soft sign. The palatalization of consonants affects the pronunciation and also the grammar of Russian.
Morphology
Morphology is the study of the forms of words and their changes. Russian morphology is very rich and complex, as it has many inflections and derivations. Inflection is the change of a word's form to express grammatical categories such as number, case, gender, tense, mood, voice, aspect, person, etc. Derivation is the formation of new words from existing ones by adding prefixes, suffixes, or changing the root.

Russian has six grammatical cases: nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, instrumental
