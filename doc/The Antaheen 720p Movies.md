The film begins with Abhik receiving a phone call from an anonymous woman who claims to be his admirer. He is intrigued by her voice and personality and starts a telephonic relationship with her. He does not know that the woman is actually Brinda, who also works at the same telecom company as him. Brinda is bored with her mundane life and finds solace in talking to Abhik, whom she admires for his articles.
 
Meanwhile, Ranjan tries to woo Brinda by sending her flowers and gifts, but she rejects his advances. He is hurt and angry and decides to take revenge on Abhik by leaking some sensitive information to a rival newspaper. This leads to Abhik losing his job and credibility as a journalist. He also finds out that Paromita is having an affair with another man and decides to divorce her.
 
Abhik and Brinda decide to meet each other for the first time at a restaurant. However, fate has other plans for them. A terrorist attack takes place at the restaurant and both of them are killed in the blast. The film ends with a voice-over of Abhik saying that he never saw Brinda's face, but he felt her presence in his life.
