Modbus is a popular data communication protocol that was originally developed by Modicon (now Schneider Electric) in 1979 for use with its programmable logic controllers (PLCs). Modbus has become a de facto standard for connecting industrial electronic devices, such as sensors, actuators, meters, and controllers[^2^].

Modbus Poll is a software tool that allows you to test and simulate Modbus devices as a master. You can use it to communicate with Modbus slaves, monitor data areas, modify registers, and troubleshoot errors. Modbus Poll supports various Modbus variants, such as RTU, ASCII, TCP/IP, UDP/IP, and RTU over TCP/IP[^1^].
 
In this article, we will show you how to use Modbus Poll 4.5.0 to test and simulate Modbus devices. You will need a computer with Windows operating system and a Modbus device or simulator. You will also need to download and install Modbus Poll 4.5.0 from the official website: [https://www.modbustools.com/modbus\_poll.html](https://www.modbustools.com/modbus_poll.html).

A dialog box will appear where you can configure the connection parameters, such as port number, baud rate, parity, stop bits, data bits, slave ID, and timeout. Make sure these settings match the ones of your Modbus device or simulator. Click "OK" to save the settings.
 
## Step 2: Create a New Document
 
Next, click on the "File" menu and choose "New". A new document window will open where you can specify the data area and register range that you want to monitor or modify. For example, if you want to read or write holding registers from address 40001 to 40100, enter "3" in the "Function" field and "40001-40100" in the "Address" field.
 
You can also choose the display format, such as decimal, hexadecimal, binary, or floating point. You can also enable or disable polling by checking or unchecking the "Poll" box. Click "OK" to create the document.
 
## Step 3: Communicate with Modbus Device or Simulator
 
Now you are ready to communicate with your Modbus device or simulator. If you enabled polling, you will see the values of the registers update automatically in the document window. You can also manually read or write registers by clicking on the "Read" or "Write" buttons on the toolbar.
 
You can also use the "Error Check" button to check for any communication errors or exceptions. If there are any errors, you will see a message box with the error code and description.
 
## Conclusion
 
Modbus Poll 4.5.0 is a useful tool for testing and simulating Modbus devices as a master. It supports various Modbus variants and allows you to monitor and modify data areas and registers easily. You can also troubleshoot errors and exceptions with the error check feature.
