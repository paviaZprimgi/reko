Chaos theory is a branch of mathematics and physics that studies complex and dynamic systems that are sensitive to small changes in initial conditions. This means that a slight difference in the starting point of a system can lead to vastly different outcomes over time. This phenomenon is also known as the butterfly effect, which states that a butterfly flapping its wings in one part of the world can cause a hurricane in another part.
